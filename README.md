## What is Chatbot?
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built:
  ### 1. Retrieval based 
          A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select             the appropriate response. It is widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and             flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best experience.
  2. Generative based models.
