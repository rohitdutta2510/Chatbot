# Chatbot
Retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python

## What is Chatbot?
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built:

### 1. Retrieval based models
A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response. It is widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best experience.   
  
### 2. Generative based models
Generative models are not based on some predefined responses.
They are based on seq 2 seq neural networks. It is the same idea as machine translation. In machine translation, we translate the source code from one language to another language but here, we are going to transform input into an output. It needs a large amount of data and it is based on Deep Neural networks.


## The Dataset

The dataset we will be using is ‘intents.json’. This is a JSON file that contains the patterns we need to find and the responses we want to return to the user.
